# Deep-Learning

Attempt on Kaggle Competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer
* I tried to normalize the data and build Input pipelines for the model.
* Adding custom activation functions, initializers, regularizers, and constraints to the models
* Built MLP with standardization layer using lambda layer
* Built CNN model.
* MLP model achieved an accuracy of: 0.9695 and a loss of: 0.1017
* CNN model achieved an accuracy of: 0.9767 and a loss of: 0.0824
* Performed evaluation and visualization for both models
