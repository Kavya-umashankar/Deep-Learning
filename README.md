# Deep-Learning

Attempt on kaggle Competation : https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer

* I tried to normalize the data and build Input pipelines for the model.
* Adding custom activation functions, initializers, regularizers, and constraints to the models
* Built MLP with standardization layer using lambda layer
* Built CNN model .
* MLP model acheived accuracy of: 0.9695 and loss of : 0.1017
* CNN model acheived accuracy of: 0.9767 and loss of : 0.0824
* Performed evaluation and visualization for both models
